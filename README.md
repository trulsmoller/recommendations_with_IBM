# Title: Recommendation of Articles with IBM Watson Studio datasets

## Author: Truls MÃ¸ller
## Date: 14-June-2020

In this project I made a recommendation engine using rank based and user-user based collaborative filtering

## Files

The project can be understood from the notebook file: Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb
Also availble as a html version for viewing in a web brower: Recommendations_with_IBM.html

The template for this notebook was provided by Udacity as part of their Data Scientist Nanodegree.

Please note that I have not completed the optional exercised towards the end of the notebook. I may revisit this at a later stage.

The underlying data files found in the data folder are:

- articles_community.csv
- user-item-interactions

## Installation
No other libraries beyond a standard Anaconda distribution of Python.

Python version: 3.7.6


#### Source and Licensing
The **dataset** owner is [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/watson/)
